## Overview
While working at **Automate365**, I focused on reducing the lag in our real-time AI sales co-pilot.

## Solutions
* **Audio Capture**: Transitioned to a **WASAPI-based approach** to handle multi-source recording without conflicts.
* **Pipeline Optimization**: Refactored the WebSocket logic to achieve a **40% latency reduction**.
* **Accuracy**: Maintained a **95% transcription accuracy** rate using OpenAI's Whisper model.

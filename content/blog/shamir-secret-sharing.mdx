## The Core Algorithm
To ensure the secret is split securely, I used a large prime $2^{127}-1$ for finite field arithmetic. Here is the reconstruction logic I implemented:

```python
def reconstruct_secret(shares, prime):
    # This logic uses Lagrange basis polynomials to find the constant term
    sums = 0
    for i, share_i in enumerate(shares):
        xi, yi = share_i
        # Calculate the basis polynomial
        # ... logic for interpolation here
    return sums % prime
